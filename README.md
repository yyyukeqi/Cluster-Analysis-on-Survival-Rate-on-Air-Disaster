# Cluster-Analysis-on-Survival-Rate-on-Air-Disaster

Comparing the data from the twenty century to the twenty-first century, is there a rising number of airplane crashes due to more people traveling or decreasing number of airplane crashes due to technological improvement with more advanced aircraft manufacturers? These data and analysis on a variety of facts and factors that cause airplane crashes can be an asset to airports, aerospace companies, governments seeking to improve the passengerâ€™s air-safeness, own reputations, and decrease the number of deaths caused by air crushes to wider people.


- What are the similarities and differences between airplane crashes with high survival rates and crashes with high fatalities? The segments will then be explored to discover the possible differences based on the properties of aircraft (Aircraft model, Capacity) or causes of crashes(Damage Type, incident category).
